/**
 * Answer the roster as the app sees it once a draft is over.
 *
 * The demo league is permanently mid-draft, which is the right fixture for most
 * of what this suite checks — but the Team pass deliberately withholds a set of
 * controls *during* a draft. Balanced, Floor and Ceiling are three definitions
 * of the best lineup and Compare asks which of two players to start; neither
 * question exists while half the roster is unpicked, so neither control is
 * drawn until the draft ends. See the note on `team-controls` in `TeamScreen`.
 *
 * Any spec that needs those controls has to say which season it is standing in,
 * and this is how it says so. `live` is the one field that decides which of the
 * two Team screens is showing, so it is the only thing overridden; every number
 * underneath is the deployment's own.
 *
 * Call it *before* navigating to Team — a route installed after the request has
 * gone out changes nothing.
